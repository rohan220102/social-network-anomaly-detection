# social-network-anomaly-detection
The main objective of this project is to identify and analyze anomalies within the community structure of social networks. After establishing communities formed by the nodes, we will focus 	on detecting unusually dense clusters of nodes associated with a disproportionately high number of communities. These anomalies could indicate the presence of bots in a network, or manipulative behaviors, like spreading fake information and news, which can harm communities and limit the social interactions between people in those communities. By accurately identifying these irregularities, we hope to find out new ways to discover malicious nodes in an otherwise healthy community.
